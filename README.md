# Patient Analysis App

## Overview
This application is built using Ionic Angular and integrates speech recognition and text-to-speech functionalities. It's designed to interact with patients by asking questions, recognizing and analyzing their responses, and then generating a score that helps in assessing the possibility of conditions like Parkinson's or Alzheimer's.

## Features
- **Speech Recognition**: Utilizes `@capacitor-community/speech-recognition` for understanding patient responses.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Leverages `@capacitor-community/text-to-speech` for asking questions to patients.
- **Analysis Algorithm**: Analyzes the responses and calculates a score indicating the likelihood of Parkinson's or Alzheimer's.
